## Project Overview
Our team has designed a Monte Carlo simulation model for aircraft evacuation, inspired by the successful evacuation during the [Haneda Airport runway collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Haneda_Airport_runway_collision) on January 2, 2024. 
Despite the severity of the incident, where a runway collision led to further damage and casualties involving another aircraft, the Airbus A350-900 managed to evacuate all 367 passengers, including 8 infants, and 12 crew members safely from three of its eight evacuation slides (doors 1L, 1R, and 4L).
The Haneda Airport incident highlights several key factors that contributed to the successful evacuation:
1.	Efficient Use of Evacuation Slides: Evacuation through only 3 out of 8 slides underscores the critical role of accessibility and decision-making during emergencies.
2.	Passenger and Crew Preparedness: The crew's timely coordination and passenger compliance were essential in achieving a rapid and orderly evacuation.
This incident serves as a real-world case study demonstrating that under controlled yet high-pressure scenarios, effective evacuation strategies can significantly reduce casualties and save lives.

## Our Project Objective
Building on these insights, our team designed a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze and model various factors that influence aircraft evacuation times and outcomes. Specifically, our simulation explores:
1.	The Impact of Exit Accessibility and Usage: Comparing scenarios with varied exit availability (e.g., using 3 vs. 8 exits).
2.	Passenger Behavior and Training: Simulating differences between trained passengers (following a "use the nearest exit" strategy) and untrained passengers who rely on intuition.
3.	Mobility Constraints: Investigating the effect of passengers with mobility impairments and the role of crew assistance.
By employing Monte Carlo methods, which rely on repeated random sampling and probabilistic modeling, our project aims to identify critical bottlenecks and propose optimized strategies to enhance evacuation efficiency and safety under diverse conditions.
